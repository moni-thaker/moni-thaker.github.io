<h2>CTiS: Assignment 3</h2>
<h3>Team 1211</h3>

<hr>

<h3>Chosen Topic:</h3>
<h2>Machine Learning & AI in Modern Day Entertainment</h2>
<h3>Case Studies in Streaming Services, Social Media and Games</h3>

<p> 
AI or otherwise known as Artificial Intelligence, is a branch of computer science that mainly focuses on the development of intelligent machines that mostly act and reach in the same way as humans do. It is commonly used by many online platforms to draw the attention of internet users to provide safe and personalized recommendations depending on their prior searches, purchases, or other online activity.
</p>

<p><b>
Case Study 1: Games
</b></p>
<p>
Game engine AI made using machine learning methods such as 'self-play' have been able to master highly skill and thought intensive games such as chess, poker and Dota 2.
In all three examples, AI have been able to compete against and successfully defeat world champion level players in each respective game. These AI powered game engines dominate their respective games, resulting in a number of both opportunities and risks.
</p>

<p><b>
Case Study 2: Streaming Services
</b></p>
<p>
Streaming serivecs (and social medias alike) such as Netflix and Spotify all use machine learning or AI to make the user experience worth their while. Machine learning which is a
subset of AI is the process in which algorithms are read and developed continually to improve user experience. 
</p>

<p><b>
Why we chose this topic:
</b></p>
<p>
</p>
The reason why we chose this topic is because it has such a big technological impact on modern day society that most of us don't even realise, like face recognition on the iPhone, healthcare in hospitals, online banking or even google maps. We thought this would be a productive topic to research considering it's significance and modern relevancy.
We chose to cover multiple different case studies under the overarching topic of "Machine Learning & AI in Entertainment" to cover a broader range of subjects while still limiting our scope to one particular field.
