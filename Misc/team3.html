<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>
When looking at the different ethical reflections, I did not take into account all of the different ways in which AI and deep learning can affect us all through its various algorithms: the ways in which these apps work include the  disadvantages that come with them. There are a range of growing concerns I have about the collection of data within Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. Since all personal data, including videos and content that has been watched via a user's account is recorded within the system, there is a risk in terms of a user's data being taken from them, thus leaving their accounts with the risk of being spied on. This poses a breach of many users’ privacy, as well as their overall safety online. Social media bots, also known as “botnets,” are a series of internet-connected devices which are capable of DDoSing (targeting with a denial distribution of service attack) a user’s device and possibly interfering with their own internet connection. One way in which security can be affected is through data mining. When an account is created on any of the apps mentioned above, there is a section which includes the user's location and other personal information including name and birthdate. Personal interests are also taken into account, as this is how the programs create recommendations. All the data is stored by corporations, and will occasionally be shared outside with third parties, making private data vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>
Another issue which is created from data mining is the sharing and overall exposure to malware. Malware is a type of software that can access the data within the computers: various types of malware include ransomware, which can take any money that belongs to an online user by interfering with his or her bank account, spyware, software used to steal personal data through data mining, and adware, advertisements that are forced onto one's internet browser against the viewer's will. Criminals and hackers can gather the data with these tools on various social media platforms and distribute the malware throughout the internet. 
</p>
<p>
I believe that many apps try to combat the various types of ads and viruses, as well as malware through a variety of data protection and encryption techniques. Many companies keep all of their data safe through the use of key encryption, with different encryption keys to unlock the data and to keep data to their own companies respectfully. While the data is stored on a server, it is encrypted while it is stored within the program's database. However, with an abundance of criminals and hackers, I personally think that there will be new methods or plans on cracking various pieces of code. Despite the desperate attempts Instagram, YouTube and TikTok may make, there always could be the slight risk that comes with these various threats. 
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, I believe that there are many threats that come with the rising number of cybercriminals as well as the many methods hackers will try to steal users' data on social media apps such as Instagram, TikTok and YouTube through malware, data mining and spyware, as well as the abundance of botnets online. This could not just cause problems and risks for those using the app, but the developers behind it.
