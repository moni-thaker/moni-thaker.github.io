<h2>Case Study 1: Games</h2>
<h3>Risks</h3><hr>

<p><b>
(The risks discussed will primarily focus on chess, but these concepts can also be applied to other games that utilise strong competitive AI such as poker and the Japanese game Go)
</b></p>
<p>
A rising concern due to the increase in prevalence in AI powered chess engines is that the game is becoming less creative due to the "soulless calculations" of the AI, which dominate the meta game and are responsible for creating the most popular opening plays, which leads pro players to simply memorise as many of these scenarios as possible. This results in a majority of high-level games reduced down to sequences produced by the AI being performed by a player purely through memory. 
</p>
<p><b>
"For quite a number of games on the highest level, half of the game-sometimes a full game-is played out of memory." (Kramnik 2020)
</b></p>
<p><b>
"You don't even play your own preparation; you play your computer's preparation." (Kramnik 2020)
</b></p>
<p>
Another issue which directly counteracts one of the key positive aspects of chess engines is that the AI cannot be effectively 'copied' since the machine does not actually 'think' like a human but rather 'searches' using it's algorithms to come up with the best possible move given the current state of the game. This means that even though most players will likely never beat an AI due to its sheer skill and game knowledge, that does not mean that the AI adopts a particular playstyle or makes consistent moves with a clear thought process that a player can easily learn from or adapt to. 
</p>
<p>
The highest difficulty ratings of the most popular chess AI such as AlphaZero and Stockfish can be overwhelming for the average or casual player. Being heavily punished for the slightest mistakes while simultaneously being bombarded by consecutive near-perfect moves and responses would not at all be a productive learning experience for any average or casual player. Therefore, for the best learning experience, players must choose a difficulty level that better matches their own skill (where the player is actually able to contest the AI) to realistically improve. However, these AI with suppressed (or 'nerfed') skill may play very erratic, unrealistic or nonsensical moves, making plays that don't make sense just to balance the skill of the AI to better match the player, resulting in potentially unreliable and unproductive learning experiences. 
</p>
<p>
With the exponential rise in the popularity of online chess, especially due to covid lockdown in 2020 through websites such chess.com and lichess.org that allow ranked matchmaking and official tournaments, cheating has become a very prevalent issue. The problem stems from AI powered chess engines being so advanced that players could simply, during their real game, play their opponents moves against an AI engine and copy the near-perfect responses, leading to easy and undeserved wins. In the modern digital age, using AI in this way to cheat has become very popular on online chess websites, which has forced the development of super accurate cheat detection methods (which coincidentally also utilises AI). 
</p>
<p><b>
"However, the growing popularity of online chess, especially in recent months, has led to an increase in the number of people completely outside of the chess world trying to win major online tournaments, and some of these people have tried to use chess engines to play better than they normally would at the chessboard.""
