<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>
Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence is an ever-evolving industry that’s become an important part of modern technology, opening up pathways for future leaps in technological advancements. As AI technology continues to rapidly progress, the uses for AI in the modern world are proportional, becoming a significant factor in multiple different fields such as streaming services, social media and gaming. Although there are undisputed benefits to the addition of artificial intelligence in society, it does not come without its concerns. Key ethical concerns regarding AI’s increase in prevalence include private data collection, unemployment and ruining competitive integrity . Privacy is questioned as titan companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon all use AI to collect their users’ personal data. This is usually done in order to better enhance the user experience and further improve the services they offer to specifically cater towards their users. However, this also poses potential ethical risks on its users such as privacy violations,  compromised information and racial bias issues.

I personally see the ongoing progress of artificial intelligence as one of modern technologies' most promising ventures. In my eyes, AI has the capability to benefit our lives in countless different ways and in many different aspects of life. Even during this assignment, limited to covering the use of AI in streaming services, social media and gaming I was still able to further educate myself and curate a deeper understanding about the subject. I was able to see the positives and benefits as well as the negatives and risks associated with AI. Even though I believe there are many advantages of AI within the topic such as an increased quality of life (in the context of streaming services) and valuable learning resources (in the context of gaming/chess). Despite the benefits of AI within our chosen topic, there are still potential risks to users, notably being breaches in privacy and creating new opportunities to cheat. I personally feel as though with how it currently stands, the positives that come with advancement of AI greatly outweigh the potential risks, but it is impossible to know if this is how it will remain, as AI continues to consistently develop in the future.

<p>
Collection of personal data is one of society's main issues when it comes to the use of AI in streaming services and social media. To combat this, I recommend that companies be open and honest as to what exactly is being done with the personal information that is being gathered, may it be to provide more accurate recommendations or even negatively; sell to third party companies. Due to the increase in popularity of online chess, using AI powered chess engines to cheat has become one of the games’ main concerns. I recommend that the companies that create these chess engines take responsibility and put resources into developing more robust anti-cheat measures, to help preserve competitive integrity and reduce the improper use of AI.
