<h2>Case Study 1: Games</h2>
<h3>Opportunities</h3><hr>

<p><b>Poker & Chess:</b></p>
<p>
Self-play AI's start from scratch without any human or prior AI knowledge used as an input and gradually improves as it learns which actions and outcomes are the most beneficial through repeatedly playing against itself, developing a strategy and deeper knowledge of the game.

Various AIs that are self-taught through machine learning have been able to master some very skill and thought intensive games such as chess, poker and Dota 2. In all three examples, AI have been able to compete against and successfully defeat world champion level players in each respective game. These AI powered game engines dominate their respective games, resulting in a number of both opportunities and risks.
</p>
<p>
In chess, AI such as Stockfish and AlphaZero have become nearly unstoppable, being able to find the perfect move for every single possible game state, they have become the prime learning resource for beginner, intermediate and even pro players who compete at the highest level of the game. 
</p>
<p>
AI powered chess engines are far and away the most popular way to learn and improve at the game in the modern day. They are a great learning resource inclusive for all players as their difficulty levels can be adjusted depending on the skill level of the player (which gives opportunity to players of all skill levels to benefit and learn from chess AI, not just pros who are looking to practice against a perfect, unbeatable opponent). This allows for improvement through studying the AI's moves and simply playing against it and absorbing information. Specifically, the AI doesn't allow the player to make many mistakes by punishing any blunders, this makes it the most ideal resource to practice opening moves, minimise errors and help promote robust gameplay. 
</p>
<p>
Much like chess engines, Pluribus was also conceived through self-play (learning the game through playing against itself and constantly reiterating - a process of trial and error). The engine was commended by pro players for its ability to bluff, which is seen as a uniquely human trait which relies on humans' ability to lie and deceit, however the AI just sees bluffing as another possible option given a specific situation. Pluribus was a huge improvement over its predecessor Libratus (a 2-player poker AI), being able to play against and consistently defeat 6 professional players which is significantly different from 2-player poker when considering the multiplier aspect of the game. The creator of Pluribus believes that solving the concept of multiplayer poker lays the foundation for future AI's to tackle more complex problems and is a step towards ideas such as automated negotiations, better fraud detection systems and self-driving cars.
