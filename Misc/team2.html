<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>
Everyday, there are new devices that are being put into the world that rely on machine learning or forms of AI in one way or another as the world is progressively getting more advanced. Artificial intelligence has always been the high level STEM research for educational purposes. Many people these days know the power of artificial intelligence because of how developed we currently are and the potential it has to even become a bigger thing. It’s game-changing things like efficiency, speed, and other development tools may do more societal harm than economic good. Since the government has no oversight on this, private companies such as Facebook, Google, Netflix,Spotify and much much more, all use artificial intelligence to improve their user experiences. All these private companies use artificial intelligence to allow them to do more stuff better, or making fewer errors, or even capture their expertise more effectively. Because of this, most people have lost their jobs to artificial intelligence because they aren’t needed anymore. But some of these things that the artificial intelligence do are use a lot of personal data from users which may result in privacy violations such as discrimination, stolen personal information, bank accounts etc. No one knows how far artificial intelligence can go.

I haven’t thought of many ethical issues regarding AI but once I started researching about it, I noticed that it is being applied to a wide range of applications that are not related to the original development of algorithms. These algorithms can affect us in a negative way or positive way depending on how you want to look at it. The way I look at the ethical issues against artificial intelligence, it is an amazing and inspirational piece of technology that has the most powerful tool for benefiting humanity. But also it can be scary at times when you don’t know that some AI will steal your personal data such as name, phone number, address, or even pictures and videos of you without you knowing which results in your data being used (against you). I don't know if artificial intelligence will ever surpass human intelligence but I do certainly know that it is developing rapidly and it would be unpredictable what will happen next to human society. I am now always aware of what I am putting out there, where if it's my name, address, phone number, email or whatever, I will always do my research to have that trust in the product I am using.

Some recommendations I would look into is having your consumers have the right to know what you are using their information for such as why do you need their full name, their email, their address etc. All of this personal information is very critical to us and we want to know what you are using this information for so that we get a better understanding. If you are wanting to use artificial intelligence, you must know the social risks that come along with it, run pre-trials so that you aren’t amplifying any biases and errors due to issues with training algorithms.
