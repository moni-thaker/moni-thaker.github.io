<h2>Case Study 2: Streaming Services</h2>
<h3>Choices</h3><hr>

<p><b>Spotify:</b></p>
<p>
Machine learning in Spotify, which is a subset of AI, is the process in which algorithms are read through and developed continually to improve user experiences. E.g. listening habits, types of playlists you created etc. So if Spotify continues to do what they do right now, as more users are trying out Spotify and more users are returning, the more data the AI receives, the  increase of knowledge the AI has which makes user experiences more personal to their taste.
</p>
<p>
We can expect Spotify to continue to humanise data in creative ways to promote their company which involves vast amounts of data to launch a global ad campaign. Some ads highlighted are users' habits; an example of this is in 2016,  they included a headline of one user which titled "Dear person who played 'Sorry' 42 times on Valentine's Day, what did you do?". This is also an example of their huge AI function system so that users get an idea of their machine learning. 
</p>
<p>
As time progresses, innovators will encounter learning experiences that involve successful missions and even unsuccessful, also meaning failure missions. Their machine learning and AI functions are improving each second of the day as new users are joining or returning, much more data is being used to improve the application and innovators have this information to improve user experience and even though if there is failure, these are experiences we can all learn from.
</p>

<p><b>Netflix:</b></p>
<p>
Netflix is unquestionably the pinnacle of content suggestion and individualised user experience today.
</p>
<p><b>
"75 percent of users select movies based on the company's recommendations, and Netflix wants to make that number even higher""
</b></p>
<p>
Netflix originally had a system where their subscribers would rank the tv shows/movies on a scale of 1 to 5 which would help the recommendation engine. But Netflix eventually got rid of it and they used a more simplified version which is using the thumbs up or thumbs down button system along with the percentage showing between other users as well. Netflix changed the system because subscribers generally had biased opinions precisely having an impact on the algorithm.
</p>
<p>
We won't know for sure what other ideas Netflix has in mind but if they do, it will most likely be based around their recommendation engine to improve user interaction and subscribers.
